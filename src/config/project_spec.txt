## Overview
Develop a command-line calculator application in Python. The application should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- The application **must** support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The application **should** handle both integer and floating-point numbers.
- The application **will** take the operation and operands as command-line arguments or interactive input.
- The application **must** include a way to exit.

### Error Handling
- The application **must** handle division by zero gracefully, providing an informative error message.
- The application **should** handle invalid input types or incorrect number of arguments.

### Features
- A history feature **should** be implemented to display the last 5 calculations.
- The application **should** be designed with a clear separation of concerns (e.g., a class for calculator logic, a function for handling user input/output).

### Output
- The result of each operation **will** be printed to the console.
- The history **should** be displayed in a readable format.

### Implementation Details
- The application **must** be written in Python.
- Unit tests **should** be created for the core arithmetic operations.
- Basic documentation **should** be generated explaining how to run the application and its features.
