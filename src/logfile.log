## Overview
Develop a command-line calculator application in Python. The application should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- The application **must** support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The application **should** handle both integer and floating-point numbers.
- The application **will** take the operation and operands as command-line arguments or interactive input.
- The application **must** include a way to exit.

### Error Handling
- The application **must** handle division by zero gracefully, providing an informative error message.
- The application **should** handle invalid input types or incorrect number of arguments.

### Features
- A history feature **should** be implemented to display the last 5 calculations.
- The application **should** be designed with a clear separation of concerns (e.g., a class for calculator logic, a function for handling user input/output).

### Output
- The result of each operation **will** be printed to the console.
- The history **should** be displayed in a readable format.

### Implementation Details
- The application **must** be written in Python.
- Unit tests **should** be created for the core arithmetic operations.
- Basic documentation **should** be generated explaining how to run the application and its features.

Revisions required

1.  **Security:** Replace `eval()` with a safer alternative like `ast.literal_eval` or a dedicated parsing library to prevent arbitrary code execution.
2.  **Error Handling:** Improve error handling in `evaluateExpression` by relying on the exception handling of the safe evaluation method. Remove the manual string replacement and checks for division by zero.
3.  **Naming Consistency:** Rename methods like `evaluateExpression`, `getHistory`, and `addToHistory` to `evaluate_expression`, `get_history`, and `add_to_history` for better Python style (snake_case).
4.  **User Interface:** Handle potential `EOFError` exceptions in `UserInterface.getInput()` and consider adding input validation.
5.  **Redundant `__init__` methods:** Simplify or remove the `__init__` methods of `DivideByZeroError` and `InvalidInputError`.
6.  **Clarity in error messages**: Improve the error message in the `InvalidInputError` exception.
7.  **Remove unnecessary expression replacement**: Remove the line `expression = expression.replace("/ 0", "/0")` in the `evaluateExpression` method.
8.  **Remove redundant float conversion**: Remove the line `return float(result)` in the `evaluateExpression` method.
